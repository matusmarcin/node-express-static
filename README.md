# Super simple REST API with users

This is a simple node + express app serving static JSON.

It serves users (or some animals, in case I decide to change to bears or cats) on the endpoint `/users`.

I have created this for my [Intro to GraphQL presentation](https://github.com/matusmarcin/graphql-intro).
